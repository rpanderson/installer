## Contributing to the _labscript suite_

We are very grateful for all the contributions users have made in the past decade to make the _labscript suite_ the most widely used open-source experiment control and automation system in quantum science. These include development, suggestions, and feedback, and we look forward to this continuing on GitHub.


### Issue tracking

The issue tracking on GitHub is very similar to BitBucket, with the added advantage that you can add inter-repository issue references, e.g. referring to [labscript-suite/runmanager#68](https://github.com/labscript-suite/runmanager/issues/68) in any issue or pull request will link to the corresponding issue. We have imported all issues from the BitBucket repositories into the GitHub repositories. This import is not perfect (as each comment is now posted by Phil Starkey) but the comments have been modified to contain the original author attribution. We have also updated all links to files, pull requests, issues, and commits so that they point to the equivalent GitHub location and/or the archived copy of the data (as discussed above).

Please use the GitHub issue tracker (rather than the mailing list) for:

* Reporting **bugs** (when something doesn’t work or works ina way you didn’t expect);
* Suggesting **enhancements**: new features or requests;
* Issues relating to **installation**, **performance**, or **documentation**.

However, advice for how to do something with the existing functionality of the _labscript suite_ is better suited to the mailing list.


### Request for developers

We would like to reaffirm our invitation for users to directly contribute toward developing the _labscript suite_. We have established a separate discussion forum on Zulip for discussing development direction and design. If you are interested in being a part of these discussions, and/or testing and merging pull requests, please [reach out to us](mailto:labscriptsuite@gmail.com).


### Pull requests

We will continue the same feature-branch workflow as before:

1. [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) one or more of the labscript suite repositories;
2. Create a branch on your fork for a new feature; 
3. Make and commit changes to this branch; and 
4. Make a pull request back to our repository. 

These steps are broadly covered in the GitHub [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) guide, and in detail on the [NumPy development workflow](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/development_workflow.html).


### Branching model/strategy

The move to GitHub for source control and PyPI for distribution is accompanied by a slight change in the branching strategy, to improve deployment and stability of the _labscript suite_. Whereas before all versions corresponded to single commits on the master branch; dedicated branches will be used to release and service minor versions. For example, releasing v0.1.0 would see the creation of a branch named maintenance/0.1.x, used to service all 0.1 versions. As we adhere to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), bug-fixes would be applied in this branch, bumping the minor (final) version number each time, e.g. 0.1.1, 0.1.2, etc. No development will occur in these branches; new features are merged into master, and bug-fixes are cherry-picked from master.

You can learn more about this branching model at:

### Learning Git

As our former development, installation, and upgrading practices involved Mercurial revision-control, some of you may not be familiar with Git. While you no longer need to use _any_ revision control system to use the _labscript suite_, those of you wanting to contribute to development who aren’t acquainted with Git may benefit from these resources:

* NumPy: [Getting started with Git development](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/gitwash/development_setup.html)
* [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/): Very cogent information for beginners. We recommend starting with:
    * [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) (covers the basic process 
    * [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
    	_Note:_ You may notice references to ‘GitHub Flow’ in these guides (and ‘Git Flow’ elsewhere). These share some aspects of the Release Flow branching-workflow we use, but are distinct.
* [Atliassian Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials): Despite the many references to BitBucket (ignore these); there is a wealth of excellent beginner information for using Git at the command line here; and finally
* [Oh Shit, Git!?!](https://ohshitgit.com/) Mistakes happen. This is a good place to start fixing them. ([Censored version](https://dangitgit.com/).)
