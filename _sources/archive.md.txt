## BitBucket archive

Some repository metadata (such as pull request discussions) could not be migrated directly from BitBucket to GitHub. As such, we have created an archived copy of everything that was on BitBucket. This includes:

* Issues (as they appear on BitBucket);
* Pull requests discussions;
* Commit comments for every labscript suite repository; and
* Every public fork (as of 1st February, 2020).

This archive can be found at [bitbucket-archive.labscriptsuite.org](https://bitbucket-archive.labscriptsuite.org/) (this page can take some time to load for the first time). Copies of every public fork of our repositories are at [github.com/labscript-suite-bitbucket-archive](https://github.com/labscript-suite-bitbucket-archive). As this is an archive, we will not be transferring ownership of these repositories back to their original owners. However, should you wish to continue development on one of those repositories you can fork it into your own account through the GitHub web interface. Should you have uncommitted changes (or changes made after 1st February, 2020) that you wish to have archived, please contact us to discuss the best approach to including these. Please note that we are not recommending continuing development in such forks long term, due to the changes in package structure outlined above.


### What to do if you had custom code in a fork on BitBucket

_Coming soon!_

### Migrating other repositories to GitHub

Should you have other repositories on BitBucket such as labscriptlib, analysislib, userlib, or labconfig (or any project unrelated to the _labscript suite_) we strongly suggest using the tools we developed to migrate the _labscript suite_. These are [philipstarkey/bitbucket-hg-exporter](https://github.com/philipstarkey/bitbucket-hg-exporter) and [chrisjbillington/hg-export-tool](https://github.com/chrisjbillington/hg-export-tool) which can be used together. See the documentation of those projects for further details.
